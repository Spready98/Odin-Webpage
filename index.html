            <div class="hero-sub-text">A justice that I have delivered against the leaf village is no different from what you are trying to do to me. Everyone feels the same <strong>pain</strong> in losing something dear. You and I have both experienced that <strong>pain</strong>. You strive for your justice.
 
                And I strive for mine. We're both just ordinary men who have been driven to seek vengeance in the name of justice. And if one comes to call vengeance Justice such justice will only breed further vengeance and trigger a vicious cycle of hatred.
                 
                Right now we live in such a cycle. I know the past and can foretell our future. It is the same as our history. So we believe that human beings simply cannot understand each other and they never will. 
                The Shinobi World of ours is ruled by hatred.
                
                And hatred Alone.</div>
